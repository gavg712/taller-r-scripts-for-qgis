### Introduction survey

A script has been prepared for self-introduction of participants, it is hoped that this tool will be sufficient. However, this survey has been prepared in case anything goes wrong.

Access the survey from this link: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/WyweDJMv

It is recommended to use a chromium-derived browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.).

### Continuous discussion about the repository and Processing R Provider.

The workshop repository has discussion enabled, for when a participant wishes to make a comment that can be followed up in the long term. Please leave comments or suggestions at the following link: https://github.com/gavg712/taller-r-scripts-for-qgis/discussions


### Speech usage during the tutorial

Throughout the tutorial, everyone's participation is important. So the microphone and the option to present your screen will be available at any time. We ask you to be as precise as possible in your participation, in order to make the space available for other participants.

All material, activities and exercises have been tested on GNU Linux Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 11. It is expected that participants will have no problems reproducing the exercises. However, if something should happen, please be patient and understanding in order to solve it.

### Scheduled breaks.

In order to protect your health and concentration, two breaks of 5 minutes each away from the screen are planned. During the workshop we will let you know when it is time for the break.
